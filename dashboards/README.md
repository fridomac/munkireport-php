# Dashboard layouts

Put dashboard layout `YAML` files in this directory. Make sure the files end with `.yml`.
To override the default dashboard, create a file called `default.yml`.

Structure each file as follows:

```yaml
display_name: My Awesome Dashboard
hotkey: q
row1:
    - client
    - messages
row2:
    - new_clients
    - pending_apple
    - pending_munki
row3:
    - munki
    - disk_report
    - uptime
```
